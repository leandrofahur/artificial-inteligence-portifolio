# Artificial Intelligence Hub

Welcome to the **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** repository! This repository aims to explore the expansive field of AI, which is dedicated to creating machines and systems capable of intelligent behavior.

## Objectives

- Provide a comprehensive overview of AI and its subfields.
- Share insights, tutorials, and articles related to AI.
- Encourage collaboration and learning within the AI community.

## Repository Topics

1. **Machine Learning (ML):**

   - A subset of AI focused on algorithms and statistical models that enable machines to improve their performance on tasks through experience (i.e., data).

2. **Natural Language Processing (NLP):**

   - The branch of AI concerned with the interaction between computers and humans through natural language.

3. **Computer Vision:**

   - The field of AI that enables machines to interpret and make decisions based on visual data from the world.

4. **Robotics:**

   - The area of AI that deals with the design and creation of robots, often incorporating elements of ML, NLP, and computer vision.

5. **Expert Systems:**

   - AI systems that emulate the decision-making ability of a human expert.

6. **Neural Networks:**
   - A set of algorithms modeled loosely after the human brain, designed to recognize patterns.
